                    HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
                    HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
                    HTML describes the structure of a Web page
                    HTML consists of a series of elements
                    HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
                    HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.</p>
